## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion
- Use the original title of the video/text where possible (e.g. "Code Rush" instead of "Documentary of Netscape and Mozilla")
- Include the original publication year
- If you like, feel free to include a **short** description. Please keep it **short** simmilar to the other descriptions on the list
- Use the following format: `[Title](link) (publication year) - optional description`
- If an [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com) rating exists for a given video, include it at the very end of the line using the format: ` <sup>[rating/10](link)</sup>`
- Link additions should be added in chronological order of the relevant category
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome
- Check your spelling and grammar
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title
- The body of the pull request should contain the link you're adding. This makes it easier to click and visit

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, I'll ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the above guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.

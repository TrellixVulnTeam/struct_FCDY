// DC coefficients serve as an image preview, so they are coded separately.
// Subtracting predicted values leads to a "residual" distribution with lower
// entropy and magnitudes than the original values. These can be coded more
// efficiently, even when context modeling is used.
//
// Our predictors use immediately adjacent causal pixels because more distant
// pixels are only weakly correlated in subsampled DC images. We also utilize
// cross-channel correlation by choosing a predictor based upon its performance
// on a previously decoded channel.
//
// This module decreases final size of DC images by 2-4% vs. the standard
// MED/MAP predictor from JPEG-LS and processes 330 M coefficients per second.
// The average residual is about 1.3% of the maximum DC value.

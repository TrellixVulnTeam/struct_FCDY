// FIFO queues for serializing multi-bit codes to/from byte-aligned memory.
//
// Uses a 64-bit SSE lane as the buffer. Unlike regular shifts, SSE shifts do
// not depend on the CL register (successive shifts are independent) and also
// allow shifting by 64 bits (avoids conditional branches). It is faster to use
// 128-bit vectors rather than AVX-2 (easier to initialize).
//
// Both the source and sink read and write 32-bits at a time, with fewer
// conditional branches (amortized over several Insert/Extract). It is faster
// for the sink to insert values into the lower part of an SSE register.
// To maintain the FIFO property, we use byte swapping.
